<h1 style="font-size: xxx-large; text-align: center;">Our Story</h1>
<div style="display: flex;">
    <div style="padding-left: 50px; font-size: x-large; width: 300%">
        <p>On September 4th 2010, a 7.1 magnitude earthquake struck Canterbury, New Zealand, causing widespread damage - particularly in the city of ÅŒtautahi Christchurch. In the wake of the disaster, 11,000 students mobilised to help with the clean-up - coordinated by our founder, Sam Johnson.</p> 
        <p>This was the beginning of the Student Volunteer Army.</p>
        <p>Today, SVA is a network of tens of thousands of volunteers driven by a desire to help their communities. Our programmes at primary, secondary and tertiary education levels empower youth through volunteering; cultivate a lasting culture of service; and build resilient, connected communities.</p>
        <p>Together, we show up for the big events. We have evolved to become leaders of second wave crisis response, helping communities recover after disaster. Over the past decade, SVA volunteers have supported clean-up and recovery after eight national crisis events - from collecting and delivering groceries during the Covid-19 lockdowns in 2020 to operating major clean-up operations after the Auckland Anniversary weekend floods, closely followed by Cyclone Gabrielle, in 2023.</p>
